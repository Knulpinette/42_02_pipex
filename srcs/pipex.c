** Pipex
**
** Pipex is a program that mimics
**		< infile cmd1 | cmd2 > outfile
** It takes the following arguments
**		./pipex infile "cmd1" "cmd2" outfile
** The logic consists with creating a pipe and rewiring the standard inputs and
** outputs so two processes can run in parallel of each other.
**
** Very good tutorial there :

** Run_pipex
** This function creates a pipe with two ends (fd) and forks
** the main process it's given into a parent process and a
** child process (process_id returns 0).
** Since those process are run in parallel, you want to have
** the parent wait for the child_process to be done first (wait).
**
** ATTENTION ! You want to open the outfile already because it needs to be
** created first and will be created whatever happens. If you don't create it
** at the beginning, a command like ls -l | wc -l will be off count because
** ls -l will count the number of files when outfile has not been created yet.
**
** A good ressource on all those functions is this series of classes
